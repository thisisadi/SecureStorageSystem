# Secure Storage System

## **ABSTRACT**
In today’s world, simply having the capacity to transfer a file from one location to another isn’t
enough. Businesses today face multiple security threats and as a highly competitive environment,
they need a secure file transfer system to protect and reliably transfer their sensitive, businesscritical data. SECURE FILE STORAGE is a method of data sharing via a secure, reliable delivery
method. Also, we use this between a client and a server. We use Cyber Security for securing
information and communication in the presence of third parties. This technique is used to ensure
that only those persons to whom the information is intended can read it. By using the principles
of cyber security, we can prevent unauthorized users from accessing the information which is
shared privately.

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
In the cloud computing environment, security is deemed
to be a crucial aspect due to the significance of
information stored in the cloud. The data can be
confidential and extremely sensitive. Hence, the data
management should be completely reliable. It is
necessary that the information in the cloud is protected
from malicious attacks. Security brings in concerns for
confidentiality, integrity and availability of data.
Unauthorized access to information results in loss of
data confidentiality. Data integrity and availability suffers
due to failure of cloud services.

## **PROPOSED SOLUTION**
encryptoDrive is an Android App:
+ That is focused on securely authenticating the user, before
storing and sharing files. We are trying to create an application
that lets a user encrypt and decrypt any type of file without
any changes in the size during encryption & decryption.
+ The application stores every user's data in encrypted form on
the cloud.
+ The user can encrypt and decrypt any file format including image, audio, video, PDF, Word files, etc.
+ Before decrypting the files, the user needs to authenticate himself/ herself using biometric fingerprint scanning.
+ The user is also informed of the storage details such as the available storage, the storage consumed
  and the type of files uploaded, etc. through the Storage Details Section of the app.
